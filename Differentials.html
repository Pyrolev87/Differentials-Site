  <h3>What the heck is a differential?</h3>
    <p>At the most basic level, a differential is a set of gears that allow the outer wheel to rotate faster than the inner wheel.<br /> The increase in speed of the outer wheel is balanced by a decrease in speed of the inner wheel. The average of the inner and outer wheel speeds is equal to the input speed of the drive shaft.</p>

  <h3>So... Why do I need one?</h3>
    <p>When cornering, the inner wheel travels a shorter distance than the outer wheel which results in difficult and unpredictable handling, damage to tires and roads, and strain on the drivetrain</p>
    <p>A vehicle with two drive wheels has the problem that when it turns a corner the drive wheels must rotate at different speeds to maintain traction. The automotive differential is designed<br /> to drive a pair of wheels while allowing them to rotate at different speeds.</p>

  <h3>So... How does it work?</h3>
    <p>A differential is both simple and complicated.</p>
